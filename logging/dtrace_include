; Dtrace Logging Samba Include.
; The purposes of this include is to selectively enable
; Dtrace scripts to run when specific clients negotiate an SMB session
; and quit when the SMB session ends. This is done through preexec 
; and postexec scripts. Enabling them is a multi-step process:
; 1) make a directory for dtrace scripts. - only writable by "root"
; 2) copy this include file to an appropriate ex: /var/log/samba4/
; 3) add an include in the samba share's aux parameters
;    ex: include = /var/log/dtrace_includes-%a 
;        include = /var/log/dtrace_includes-%I
; 4) modify this include file to set appropriate log directories
;    and enable preexec scripts as desired.
; 5) symlink this file in a way that it gets picked up by the SMB client
;    ex: ln -s /var/log/dtrace_incudes /var/log/dtrace_includes-OSX
;              (profile OSX clients)
;    ex: ln -s /var/log/dtrace_incudes /var/log/dtrace_includes-192.168.42.42
; %d = smbd PID, %a = architecture, %I = IP of SMB client

; postexec
; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
; kill all dtrace scripts profiling the pid of the smbd process
; this is a generic catch-all.
root postexec = /bin/pkill -f %d

; preexec
; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
; pid histogram
root preexec = /bin/bash -c '/var/log/dtrace/dt_pidhist.dtrace %d > /var/log/dtrace/output/%I_%dt_pidHist 2>&1 &'
