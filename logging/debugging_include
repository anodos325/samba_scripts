; log file path is FreeBSD-specific
; enabling / disabling on a per client basis requires roughly the following
; 1 - create file with the below params - /var/log/samba4/client-debug-include
; 2 - add the following to [global] in smb4.conf "include = /var/log/samba4/client-debug-include-%I
; 3 - ln -s /var/log/samba4/client-debug-include /var/log/samba4/client-debug-include-<ip of client>
